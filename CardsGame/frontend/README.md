This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- yarn

If you aldready have the prerequisities, you are good to go!. If not, you can use `brew` to install the prerequisites.

To install brew go to : [Brew home page](https://brew.sh/)

Install prerequisities using brew:

```
brew install node
```

and

```
brew install yarn
```

## Install dependencies

In the command line go to the frontend folder and run `yarn install`.

```
cd  frontend
```

then

```
yarn install
```

## Run the app

When yarn finishes the installation of dependencies you are ready to launch the app.

To run the app try:

```
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Pull requests

In order to have a stable master branch we will use `Pull Requests` using github.
